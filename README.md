## Welcome

Hello there! Welcome to my portfolio built with [Astro](https://astro.build/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). 

But I can't take all the credit. This code was mostly lifted from [here](https://github.com/veranikabarel/astro-portfolio).

## Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
